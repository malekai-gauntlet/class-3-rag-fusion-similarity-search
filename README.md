# Class 3: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Introduction
Master a technique that integrates relevant documents into the generation process, enhancing the quality and contextuality of LLM responses. This repo demonstrates a simple RAG example and more advanced implementations.

## Prerequisites
- Docker (for containerized usage - recommended)
- Python 3.11 (for local setup)
- Pinecone account (free tier is sufficient)

## Setup

### 1. Create a Pinecone Index:
Before running the application, you need to set up a Pinecone index:

1. Log in to your Pinecone account at https://app.pinecone.io/
2. Navigate to the "Indexes" section and click "Create Index"
3. Fill in the following details:
   - Name: Choose a name for your index (e.g., "rag-project-index")
   - Dimensions: Set to `3072`
   - Metric: Choose `cosine`
4. For Environment and Region:
   - Cloud Provider: Select `aws`
   - Region: Choose `us-east-1`
   (Note: These last two options are required for a free instance)
5. Click "Create Index" to confirm
6. If you wish to run `RAG_fusion_101.ipynb` you must create a separate Pinecone index
7. For this second index, follow the above procedure but set the `Dimensions` to `1536`, and give the index a name of your choice
8. Make sure and enter this second index into the `.env` file

Remember the names you gave to your indices, as you'll need them for the `.env` file.

### 2. Set up environment variables:
- Copy the sample environment file:
  ```
  cp .env.sample .env
  ```
- Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys and other required variables:
  ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-secret-key
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your-secret-key
   LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=gauntlet_class_3
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your-secret-key
   PINECONE_INDEX=your-3072-dimension-index-name
   PINECONE_INDEX_TWO=your-1536-dimension-index-name
  ```
  Make sure to use the relevant index names you created for `PINECONE_INDEX` and `PINECONE_INDEX_TWO`, respectfully.

## Quick Start with Docker

1. Run the upload script:
   ```
   docker compose run --rm upload_service
   ```

2. Run the main RAG example:
   ```
   docker compose run --rm rag_app
   ```

3. Start Jupyter for notebook examples:
   ```
   docker compose up jupyter
   ```

4. Run a specific script (any new `.py` file you may add):
   ```
   docker compose run --rm rag_app python <script_name.py>
   ```

Note: The Docker setup will automatically use the environment variables from your `.env` file. You don't need to export them to your system environment when using Docker.

## Running Different Scripts
You can use the provided `run.sh` script for easier execution.
Make sure to make the script executable with `chmod +x run.sh` before using:
```
./run.sh upload
./run.sh main
./run.sh jupyter
./run.sh <your_new_py_file>
```

## Local Setup (Alternative to Docker)
If you prefer to run the examples locally:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```
3. Set up the environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure environment variables as described in the Setup section.
5. Export the environment variables (python-dotenv should handle this automatically in the ):
   ```
   export $(cat .env | xargs)
   ```
6. Run an example:
   ```
   python3 upload.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you're using Python 3.11.0 or later for local setup.
- For Docker issues, check your Docker installation and version.
- If you encounter package issues, try updating pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Make sure all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file.
- If you're having issues with environment variables in Docker, ensure your `.env` file is in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
- If you encounter issues with Pinecone, double-check that your index is created correctly and that you're using the correct API key and index name(s) in your `.env` file.
